    description: "After a 14-year hiatus, the Malibu returned as a front-wheel drive mid-size sedan based on GM's N-body platform. Designed to compete with the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, it featured conservative styling and a focus on value. Initially powered by a 2.4L four-cylinder or 3.1L V6 engine, it prioritized comfort and efficiency over performance. The 1997-1999 models had a silver Malibu logo in the center grille, while 2000-2003 models featured the blue Chevrolet emblem. This generation helped reestablish the Malibu in the important mid-size sedan segment."

The 2013 Malibu featured more aerodynamic styling and reduced weight. Initially criticized for tight rear seat room, a 2014 refresh addressed this issue.

Built on GM's E2XX platform, it featured sleek, coupe-like styling with a four-inch longer wheelbase creating significantly more interior space while being nearly 300 pounds lighter than the eighth generation. Engine options included a standard 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder and optional 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder. The ninth-generation also introduced the first hybrid version, a 1.8L hybrid model.

    description: "Chevrolet updated the Malibu in 2018 for the 2019 model year with a new larger front grille split by a chrome bar and the Chevrolet bowtie. The rear received less significant changes. The Premier trim added LED headlamps while other trims retained halogen units. A new RS trim was introduced for a sportier appearance with a black grille, unique 18-inch wheels, and dual exhaust. The standard 1.5L turbocharged engine was paired with a CVT instead of the 6-speed automatic. Safety features were improved including Low Speed Forward Automatic Braking and IntelliBeam high-beam assist. The 2.0L turbocharged engine was discontinued after 2022, and the 2.0L gasoline engine was removed entirely for 2023. Production ended in North America in November 2024 as the Fairfax Assembly plant was retooled for the second-generation Chevrolet Bolt. The Malibu XL continues production in China."
